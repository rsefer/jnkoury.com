description: 'A reworking of the existing curved walls in lobby high lighting a new product. The existing lobby design curved walls combining with the opposite arc of the exterior wall limit space. The design approach worked with the curves, by making the new wall a tighter radius which increases the angle toward the reception desk putting in in more direct view of visitors. The wall is given a thickness to house niches featuring both monitors, and the device itself. To simplify the audio/visual equipment servicing, the space between the existing curved wall and the new curved wall provides controls and access points for the equipment.'
