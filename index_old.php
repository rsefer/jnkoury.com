		<p>Understanding the desired use of space, whether for home, work, or community, is the starting point of design. Quality, scale and place; utilizing the materials harvested and brought to your building site in the most effective way, building design addresses these concepts to enhance, delight and facilitate their intended use.</p>

		<p class="leftCol">My experience ranges from 200 square foot home renovations, office suites to large industrial to public spaces. These vastly different scaled projects share in common a need for human scale created for the individual to find place, to speak to them. The largest scale project should not overwhelm and the smallest room should feel spacious.<br><br></p>
		<p>Projects are not only about the built building, they are about processes, communication and relationships. My office is aiming to be the best, offering the best design services, offering the best client experiences.</p>
