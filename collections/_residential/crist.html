description: 'A 4,500-5,000 sf single family residence, wood framed, walk out lower level. Aesthetic is an interpretation of american traditional, familiar, but not common. Open floor plan, but make spaces within spaces. This is how people relate and interact within the home. The open floor plan is a challenge of the small social family group. The spaces inform where we should be sitting, where we gather, where is circulation, what is public, what is private.'
