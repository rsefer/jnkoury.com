description: "In this project, a straight forward office refit with back of house warehouse and front of house show room is required. A tight budget saw many of the walls re-used and maintained, but the desire to transform the front space and get rid of the air lock at the front door led to design a reception desk that acts as a screen between public and private, display wall and anchoring element at the circulation hub of the office. One element serving many purposes."
