		<p><strong>This project is a dormer addition and interior alteration to a mountain log home. The owners are dissatisfied with the existing small windows at the front of the house with views of mountain top rock faces.</strong></p>
		<p>The goal is to let additional light into now, existing dark spaces and increase the living area in the master suite upstairs to improve the room layout and closet space. In maintaining the informal language of the log cabin, we opted to replace the undersize gable end dormers with one large shed dormer, extending from the double height living room across the space into the master suite on the second floor, along with increase the size of existing first floor windows. Using this large shed dormer keeps the language informal, and provides proportional element above the large porch overhang.</p>

		<p><strong>Update: Golden, Colorado Residence</strong></p>
		<p>Further development on this project has seen what was once a renovation, second floor addition and a separate shop structure be combined into essentially two additions. One addition is to the rear of the site, containing the shop space with new bedrooms, bathrooms and mudroom at the juncture of existing and new. The other scope of the addition is to extend the roof line at the end of the home where the subgrade garage will be rebuilt in place of the problematic existing garage. After studying the owners' goals, the approach of adding the kitchen over the new garage opened space and flexibility for the public living space of the home, as well as giving the home a new element articulated by the mass at the side wall housing the kitchen equipment and glass connecting the new element to the existing structure. This allows for the openness to both the mountain view out the rear and front of the house. This will also satisfy the owners request to have the public space of the house flow into the exterior entertaining space of the garage top deck. These are preliminary images with an investigation ahead for a front porch pergola and a sun screen in place of the kitchen overhang. With the many different ways to house the many varied functions of this project, many different roof forms and shapes were studied. However, retaining the existing roof form with extensions to cover the new space has yielded the most compelling design and constructible solution. This reinforces my belief that the most simple solution is often the best.</p>

		<p><strong>I appreciate mid century design. Qualities this era of buildings have is direct, open layouts and material uses. I am thrilled to be working on a project that aims squarely at bringing a mid century building back to its original form.</strong></p>
		<p>This era of building was a time of great optimism and embrace of modern of transport and material. The goal of our project is to uncover the quality of lightness seen in the original facade at the curved glass window and remove the t111 cladding added over the years. The building’s current use differs from the original gas station; it is home of a selection of quality beers. The space has a personality imparted on it from the owner or helpful service, enthusiasm and knowledge of the whats for sale. The renovated building will retain the current retail floor space, with adding a bar area at the curved glass wall. A reworking of the interior space along with select interior demo will free up space for this use. The exterior will include courtyard seating and bocce type courts.</p>

		<p>A couple of aspects the owner and myself have identified to make this work is to retain the feeling the current space has as a well worn, comfortable space that has depth. You don’t quite understand all that is in there with one glance. We also want to retain the language of the former without reverting to some of the more common caricatures of what we think buildings of that era looked like. Kind of like drawing a car from the 1950’s. It is likely, one of the defining features of the car, would be rendered in an exaggerated manner, almost cartoon like. We will aim at keeping the structure to a minimum like the original and let the atmosphere of conversation, beer and community lead the way.</p>

		<p><strong>Masterplanning. Multifamily, multi building apartment project infilling an existing partially built development.</strong></p>
		<p>Like nested Russian dolls, master planning has shared logic with the arrangement of a home or even a room. The structure is very similar, but at a vastly different scale. At this project’s scale the introduction of the car requires consideration of how do people move about the spaces in cars versus on foot? How can the plan give them the best access from where they will park? How do you make that work while also considering the bigger question of creating the framework of a good neighborhood while still working with the qualities of the site?</p>

		<p><strong>Restoring a higher value to a building or space that no longer serves the user as well as it could: this statement sums up most renovation projects.</strong></p>
		<p>This project addresses a need for a shop building added to the site shared with a to be expanded brick ranch built in the 1950s. A check with the zoning regulations shows that a n accessory building of 20' in height can be built on the lot with the primary structure not to exceed 30'. These limitations are good things in this case.</p>
		<p>With two buildings sharing the same space, it brings up questions of primary and secondary and how does that effect the form of each of the buildings? It is similar to the unspoken contextual language of buildings informing the individual with a feeling of comfort or uncertainty upon approach of the front door of a home or business.</p>
		<p>Do you question, is this the right place for me to be? The language of the building is a big part of what makes you comfortable or question if you are in the right spot. This is relevant to this project because the program of the shop building requires a footprint approaching that of the house. What is appropriate relationship between the two? If they are both about the same size, which is primary and which is accessory? Should they be siblings or more cousins in their design similarities?</p>
		<p>The solution proposed is the two be distinct buildings, the home with its new roof line, second floor and front porch is to be more detailed and more developed in its language. The shop building is to be more utilitarian and direct in its form, reflecting its intended use- more distant cousins with shared eye color and maybe shape of nose, but different in overall look.</p>
		<img id="shopbuilding" src="{{ "/onetheboards/shopbuilding-brickranch.jpg" | prepend: site.imagebase }}">
		<p>What is shared between the two are low rooflines, first to maintain the scale of the original ranch and second, once the shop building is built to maintain the hierarchy of primary structure and accessory structure of house and shop respectively.</p>
		<p>An overall effort of both buildings is to keep roof lines simple in form, capture natural light and take advantage of the views out of the front of the house of the front range mountains near by. The time frame of this project is longer than most, with the shop being built first, followed by the second floor and other associated alterations around the existing home.</p>

		<p><strong>It is always exciting to have a client that wants to take something which once had value, has been in decline and return to something of value.</strong></p>
		<p>This project is to take a 1950’s era masonry building, originally built as a chocolate factory, most recently used as a nightclub, and transform it into a showroom, office and warehouse for a local business. A few items of note, there is a great view of downtown from the facade facing the side yard parking area, as many of the existing walls will be reused, with select demolition, natural light for the office work space is a priority, and the clear height to the underside of the bowstring trusses is 18’. A few of these things work well together: the high clear height, the good view and the desire to have natural light in the open work space.</p>

		<img id="true-north-existing" src="{{ "/onetheboards/true-north-existing.jpg" | prepend: site.imagebase }}">
		<p class="clear">The proposed plan loads the showroom at the street front, along with the reception area, with executive offices, conference rooms and open office running from front to back in the space. The warehouse functions are loaded at the end of the office spaces, close to the rear doors so personnel can monitor the shipping/receiving area.</p>
		<p>The exterior gets a select alteration. To make the most of the budget, existing windows are retained, except in the area of the showroom/main entry where slender tall windows from the floor extend to 12’ with irregular widths. The existing exterior stair gets reused, with the addition of a masonry screen wall, which extends toward the rear of the building creating a wall for the new accessibility ramp into the showroom. The masonry used on the screen wall will be echoed at the new planter base at the building corner. This new area will be covered with a suspended metal canopy giving the entire corner of the building a new identity which is the result more of subtraction than addition.</p>
